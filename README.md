# Pennsylvania Policy Database Upload Bills Data Tool.

This is a stand-alone program to upload the data from the Pennsylvania Legislature 
Web Site bill history xml file to the PAPolicy_Copy database. It includes the 
analysis of the bill history to determine the final state of the bill in both 
the legislature houses and the governor.

It can also be used as a library for the PPDBApp so that the file upload for
Bills Data is loaded into the database.
